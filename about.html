			<h1>about me</h1>
			hi, my name is danil, and i am a ukrainian 15 year old kid that enjoys messing with his iphone 6, and computers in general.
			<br>
			i also am very hyperactive (adhd), however suffer from anger management issues. i know 3 languages (russian, turkish and english) and learning 4th (german).
			<br>
			i live in t√ºrkiye, istanbul and i have been here for 5 or so years now, and very much like it here.
			<br>
			i dont have many friends in real life and i am pretty kept to myself, so i usually spend most of my time online on discord or such.
			<br>
			also i like making new friends. if i like you, theres a high chance that i might be annoying or needy towards you, and try to talk to you almost everyday.
			<br>
			as a result of my anger issues, i might lash out at you, or other people. if so, then i am really sorry, as i might have not been in the proper mood. or you caused something for me to not like you 
			<br>
			<br>
			oh yeah, im furry trash. theres that, meow :3
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>contacts</h1>
			ofcourse, a description about me by me would never do me justice, so if you want to, you can friend me on discord and chat with me. i would be more than happy to accept your friend request :)
			<br>
			i am also on twitter, but i much less frequently go on it.
			<br>
			<br>
			my accounts on different platforms:
