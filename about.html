			<h1>about me</h1>
			<p>hi, my name is danil, and i am a ukrainian 15 year old kid that enjoys messing with his iphone 6, and computers in general.</p>
			<p>i also am very hyperactive (adhd), however suffer from anger management issues. i know 3 languages (russian, turkish and english) and learning 4th (german).</p>
			<p>i live in t√ºrkiye, istanbul and i have been here for 5 or so years now, and very much like it here.</p>
			<p>i dont have many friends in real life and i am pretty kept to myself, so i usually spend most of my time online on discord or such.</p>
			<p>also i like making new friends. if i like you, theres a high chance that i might be annoying or needy towards you, and try to talk to you almost everyday.</p>
			<p>as a result of my anger issues, i might lash out at you, or other people. if so, then i am really sorry, as i might have not been in the proper mood. or you caused something for me to not like you</p> 
			<br>
			<p>oh yeah, im furry trash. theres that, meow :3</p>
			<br>
			<h1>contacts</h1>
			<p>ofcourse, a description about me by me would never do me justice, so if you want to, you can friend me on discord and chat with me. i would be more than happy to accept your friend request :)</p>
			<p>i am also on twitter, but i much less frequently go on it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>my accounts on different platforms:</p>
